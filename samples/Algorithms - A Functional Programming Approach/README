The files in this directory are Haskell modules and examples of use
given in the book
            Algorithms: a functional programming approach
               Fethi A. Rabhi, University of Hull, UK
               Guy Lapalme, Université de Montréal, Canada

Each chapter has a subdirectory named after the number of the chapter:
Each file is a Haskell module of the same name as the file.

The convention for naming a file is as follows:
    SX_Y_Z.hs
   where X = chapter number
         Y = section number
         Z = subsection number (if needed)

There are also other files (and modules) that are named after the name
of the abstract data types that they contain.  If they are imported
from another directory, it may be necessary to inform the interpreter
where they are locared, for example  in Hugs do
  :set -P../Chapter5:{Hugs}/lib:{Hugs}/lib/hugs:{Hugs}/lib/exts
if the modules are in ../Chapter5

The Answer directory shows scripts giving the solutions to selected 
exercises. 

The Other directory show other examples of Haskell programs but which
are not described in the book

The programs have been tested in October 1998 using Hugs 1.4
