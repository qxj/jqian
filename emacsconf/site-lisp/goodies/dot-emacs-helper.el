;;; Commentary:

;; * Who need it?
;;  If you only write hundreds lines in .emacs, you won't consider this
;;  extension. But if you have thousands lines in .emacs, you may want
;;  such thing to organize configuration like me.
;;
;; * How to use it?
;;  Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'dot-emacs-helper)
;;
;;  I recommend write this in .emacs for port config to other emacs that
;;  don't have this extension:
;;
;;     (unless (require 'dot-emacs-helper nil t)
;;       (defmacro deh-require-maybe (feature &rest forms)
;;         (declare (indent 1))
;;         `(progn (when (require ,feature nil t) ,@forms)))
;;       (defalias 'deh-require 'deh-require-maybe)
;;       (put 'deh-require 'lisp-indent-function 1)
;;       (defmacro deh-section (section &rest forms)
;;         (declare (indent 1))
;;         `(progn ,@forms)))
;;
;;  And rewrite you .emacs as:
;;
;;    (deh-require 'feature-name
;;      configuration-for-the-feature)
;;    (deh-section "section-name"
;;      some-configuration)
;;
;;  And when you want edit some configuration, use M-x
;;  `deh-customize-inplace' or M-x `deh-customize' to make changes. It
;;  knows where you put the configuration. The former maybe more
;;  reliable, but I like `deh-customize' more.
